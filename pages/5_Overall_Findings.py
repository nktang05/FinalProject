    """Overall findings are that does appeat to be positive correlations between food prices and obesity rates, population and obesity rates, and food prices and population. The data looks the best when the food data lines up year wise with the rest of the data. However, sometimes the food data has data from the 1990's 
    but no other data in my database is from them. All variables for the most part increased over time so population has increased, food has increased, and obesity rates have also increased. Living is getting more expensive.""" )

see if they correlate with obesity rates. If groceries are more expensive, will rates of
obesity increase? Or, is there no correlation and prices of healthy vs unhealthy foods
are unrelated to obesity which means there's another main cause of obesity other than
accessibility to healthier food options in the grocery store. Maybe more physical activity
needs to be promoted and that could be seen in pre and post pandemic years. I also
want to see if changes in the population have an affect on the prices of food. Maybe
there has been no drastic change in the population yet the prices still increased. Overall findings show that all three have increased overtime. """
