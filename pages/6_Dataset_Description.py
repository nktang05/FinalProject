        This website is scrapable. It contains the data for prices of different groceries over periods of time. I can also sort it by area of the US for example west, south, midwest etc. The different grocery options are sorted by a Series ID. Using the seriesID I go back into the website and get the specific grocery p[rice data for food with that seriesID. I wrote multiple functions to get user input of food, find seriesIDs with use food in the label, let user pick which seriesID they want and then return it in a data frame to be used
